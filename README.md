# Sleep Apnea Detection Using Neural Networks

This repository contains the implementation of a novel machine learning and deep learning (ML-DL) hybrid model for the automated detection of sleep apnea. The project leverages a systematic approach to preprocess data, train a neural network, optimize its performance, and provide interpretable predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## Overview

Sleep apnea is a significant health condition that can lead to serious complications if undiagnosed. This project addresses the challenges in early detection using a deep learning-based solution that combines accuracy with interpretability. By identifying critical features like oxygen saturation and heart rate variability, the model assists healthcare professionals in diagnosing sleep apnea effectively.

Key highlights:
- High cross-validation accuracy of 94.75%.
- Feature importance insights using SHAP values.
- Scalable and modular neural network implementation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Neural Network Model:** Utilizes dense and dropout layers with ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Employs RandomizedSearchCV for fine-tuning model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation:** Calculates metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Interpretability:** Explains predictions with SHAP values and generates visualizations for feature importance.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure the dataset is in `.csv` format with features relevant to sleep apnea detection (e.g., oxygen saturation, heart rate variability).
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

5. Generate SHAP visualizations:
    ```bash
    python interpret.py
    ```

6. View results and plots in the `results/` directory.
